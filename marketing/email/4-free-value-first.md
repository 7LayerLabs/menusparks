**Email Body:**

[Name],

I was just at [Restaurant Name] last week. Great [specific dish]. 

But I noticed you have [ingredient] on the menu in 3 different dishes. That tells me you're probably sitting on excess inventory of it right now.

Here's a special you can run tonight:

**[Custom Special Name Based on Their Cuisine]**
- [Ingredient they likely have excess of]
- [Common pantry item]
- [Something from their regular menu]
- [Seasonal item currently cheap]

*Prep:* [Quick prep instructions]
*Food Cost:* Approximately $[X]
*Suggested Price:* $[Y] (68% margin)
*Why it works:* Uses items you definitely have, requires no new purchases, can be prepped in advance

Run this for three days. If it saves you from throwing away even one case of [ingredient], you've made money.

This is what MenuSparks does - except you get 5-7 of these every single week, customized to YOUR inventory, YOUR equipment, and YOUR customer base.

No obligation, but if this special works for you, I'd love to show you what else is possible.

P.S. I created this specifically for [Restaurant Name] based on your menu and what I know you're probably overstocked on. This isn't a template - this is real chef insight.
