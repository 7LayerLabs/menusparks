**Email Body:**

Hi [Name],

Maria from Casa Elena asked me to reach out to you.

She said you two talked at the last restaurant association meeting about the crazy food costs this year. She wanted me to share what she's been doing:

*"I was skeptical. Another app, another subscription. But my Sunday night special-panic is gone. I submit my overstock Monday morning - takes literally 2 minutes - and Tuesday I have my whole week planned. Last month I saved $1,400 in waste. That's not a typo."*

She's not alone:

**Tony's Italian Kitchen:** "The specials actually make sense for our kitchen. Not some fancy chef fantasy - real dishes we can execute during service."

**Pacific Fusion:** "The cost calculations alone are worth it. I finally know the exact margin on every special."

**The Garden Bistro:** "Our Instagram engagement tripled. Turns out the specials come with social media copy too."

These aren't massive chains with corporate chefs. They're local restaurants like yours, turning their excess inventory into their most profitable dishes.

The math is simple:
- You're throwing away $5,600-$11,200 annually
- MenuSparks costs $10-20/week
- ROI in the first month

Want to see what specials we could create from YOUR current inventory?

Send me a photo of your walk-in. I'll personally create 3 sample specials for free.

No pitch. No sales call. Just showing you what's possible.

Derek

P.S. We only take on 5 new restaurants per month to ensure quality. January has 2 spots left.
