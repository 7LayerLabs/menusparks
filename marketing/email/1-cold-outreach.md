Hi [Name],

I'll keep this short because I know Monday mornings are crazy.

How much time did you spend creating this week's specials? And more importantly - how much inventory are you trying to use up before it goes bad?

I own Bobola's Restaurant here in Nashua, and I got so frustrated with this problem that I built a solution. It's called MenuSparks.

Here's how it works:
- Monday morning: You tell us what's overstocked (takes 2 minutes)
- Tuesday morning: You get 5-7 complete specials using ONLY those items
- Wednesday-Sunday: You serve profitable specials instead of throwing food away

No extra ordering. No panic-creating dishes during service. Just ready-to-execute specials with exact costs and pricing.

The average restaurant using MenuSparks saves $5,600-$11,200 annually. That's real money back in your pocket.

Want to try it free for a week? No credit card needed.

Let me know and I'll set you up.

Best,
Derek

P.S. I still run my restaurant full-time, so I know this isn't another "consultant" solution. This actually works in a real kitchen.
