# Email 5: Invitation/Partnership - The Exclusive Angle

**Subject Lines to Test:**
- Private invitation for [Restaurant Name]
- Selecting 3 Nashua restaurants for case study - interested?
- Want to be our featured success story?

**Email Body:**

[Name],

I'm doing something different and wanted to see if [Restaurant Name] would be interested.

I'm selecting 3 Nashua restaurants to be founding members of MenuSparks with some serious perks:

**What you get:**
- MenuSparks free for 3 months (normally $80-160/month)
- Direct access to me for menu consultation
- Your restaurant featured in our marketing (if you want)
- Custom specials that match your exact concept
- Input on new features we develop

**What I need from you:**
- Track your waste reduction (I'll make this easy)
- Let me share your results (anonymously if preferred)
- Provide feedback on what would make this even better
- Be willing to tell other restaurants if it works

Why am I doing this?

Because I know MenuSparks works - I use it at Bobola's every week. But I need local proof that it works for different cuisines and concepts. 

[Restaurant Name] would be perfect because:
- Your [cuisine type] menu has great potential for creative specials
- You're at the size where $5,600+ in savings actually matters
- Your reputation in Nashua would mean something to other restaurants

This isn't a free trial that converts to paid. This is a genuine partnership. If MenuSparks doesn't save you at least $500 in the first month, we both walk away.

But if it does work (and it will), you get the insider rate forever - 50% off whatever we charge others.

Interested? I'm only having this conversation with 5 restaurants, and you're one of them.

Let's grab coffee this week and I'll show you exactly how it works.

Owner, Bobola's Restaurant

P.S. Tuesday morning at [Local Coffee Shop]? I'm buying.
