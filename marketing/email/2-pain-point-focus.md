# Email 2: Pain Point Focus - The Walk-In Reality Check

**Subject Lines to Test:**
- Your walk-in is lying to you
- That produce isn't going to last until Friday
- Why your food cost is really 35% (not the 28% you want)

---

**Email Body:**

[Name],

Go look at your walk-in right now. I'll wait.

See that case of [common perishable]? The one you ordered "just in case"?

We both know how this ends. Friday comes, half of it goes in the trash, and you promise yourself you'll order better next week.

But you won't. Because the problem isn't your ordering - it's that you don't have a system to turn excess into profit.

Here's what restaurants using MenuSparks are doing instead:

**Monday:** "We have too much chicken, roma tomatoes, and heavy cream"
**Tuesday:** Receive: Tuscan Chicken Special, Tomato Bisque, Chicken Alfredo Pizza, and 4 more recipes
**Wednesday-Sunday:** Sell specials at 70% profit margins instead of throwing away product

Real numbers from last month:
- Casa Elena: Saved $1,400
- The Garden Bistro: Reduced waste by 60%
- Tony's Italian: Cut special-planning time from 6 hours to 10 minutes

You're already paying for the inventory. Why not turn it into profit?

First week is free. No credit card. Just results.

Want in?

P.S. Stop adding to your order when your walk-in is already full. Seriously.
