**Headline:** "MenuSparks Saved Me 6 Hours a Week"

**Primary Text:**
"I used to spend Sunday nights panicking about specials. Digging through the walk-in, trying to use up product before it went bad.

Now I submit my inventory Monday morning, and by Tuesday I have a week's worth of specials. With exact costs. And they actually sell.

Last month alone, I saved $1,400 in food waste."
