When a chat starts or context seems unclear:
1) Reference CLAUDE.md for Derek's background and project context
2) Check MenuSparks_PRD.md for product direction and requirements
3) Review claude_startup.md for quick project refresh
4) Confirm next step in plain English before coding

Work rules:
- Follow Derek's vibecoding approach - practical, actionable solutions
- Scope changes narrowly (one file/section at a time)
- Explain planned changes before generating full code
- Stick to PRD requirements unless explicitly instructed otherwise
- For big edits: chunk changes; avoid blind full-file rewrites
- Focus on business growth and restaurant industry context

Derek's priorities:
- MenuSparks.com (current project)
- The Pour Plan (bar version of MenuSparks)
- Meet the Feed (social media platform)
- Trading and business optimization

If drift occurs:
- Re-anchor to PRD + CLAUDE.md and summarize current goal
- Ask Derek for clarification on business priorities
