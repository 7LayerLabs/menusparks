special you've been sitting on, push shrimp features, and hold 
off on salmon until November. Your food cost will thank you."

## Sample Analysis Output

### Weekly Protein Strategy
"With beef grinding 3-5% higher weekly and no relief until 
November, shift your burger mix to 70/30 chuck/brisket (saves 
$0.40/lb) or run a pork/beef blend. Your signature ribeye? 
Lock in prices now - December's looking at $14+/lb. Meanwhile, 
pork shoulder at $2.40/lb is your sleeper hit - braise it, 
smoke it, confit it - 68% food cost margin at $16 plate price."

### Seafood Opportunity Alert
"Gulf shrimp boats are dumping inventory ahead of maintenance 
season. 16/20s at $8.40/lb won't last - buy heavy for next 
10 days and freeze. Scallops are the opposite story - if you're 
not charging $32+ for your scallop entr√©e, pull it until November. 
Smart play: Shrimp & grits at $18 runs 28% food cost right now."
